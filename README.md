# Project 2 - UI/UX Design with Streamlit Report 
**Name:** Alfonsina Cardenas
**Course:** Human-Computer Interaction
**Project Theme:** The Weather
**Date:** June 6, 2025

In this project, I developed a web app using Streamlit and API requests. My web application is about the weather, and it allows the user to explore different metrics of the current weather, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure.  It also provides them with the forecast (which goes up to about a day), a map with coordinates, both measures of temperature, and graphs for visualization. 

# üéØ Usability Goals

**Effectiveness**
One of my primary goals was effectiveness, ensuring users could easily navigate the web application and access the weather details they care about, such as humidity, temperature, and wind speed. The data is retrieved from a reliable API (OpenWeatherMap), which ensures the information is accurate and trustworthy.

**Efficiency**
Another key goal was efficiency, or how quickly and easily users can perform tasks. In the application, once users select a location and click "Get Weather," the weather data loads instantly, ready to explore and analyze with minimal waiting time.

**Learnability**
Learnability refers to how easy it is for new users to understand and begin using the app. To support this, I included clear instructions, labeled input fields, and friendly feedback messages. For example, success boxes confirm when weather data has loaded successfully, and information messages at the end of each page help guide users to the next step (choosing an option from the sidebar).

**Memorability**
When users return to the design after a period of time, they should find it easy to remember how to navigate the app. The design of the app is consistent and repeatable. The text box and select box process is simple, so they can immediately begin using the app and getting the weather. Also, the instructions at the top of each feature helps the user understand what to do.

**Error Prevention**
When the user inputs a location that is not identified by the API, they will get an error message to let them know. The message will also tell them to check their input again and retry.

**User Satisfaction**
User satisfaction describes how pleasant it is to use the design of the app. The users will be able to interact with the app, such as changing the background color and moving sliders to find out how certain metrics will affect the weather and themselves. In addition, feedback and messages will be given in a friendly tone that makes the user more comfortable.
